**Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Project Gemini

**Motivation** 

As university students, my project partner and I have observed that mindfulness is not well known among our peers. Many have either never heard of it or are unsure of its meaning. Additionally, they face numerous barriers to practicing mindfulness, such as a lack of time, the inconvenience of traditional journaling, and uncertainty about how to begin. Motivated by these challenges, we aimed to create MindSpace, a mobile application that leverages technology to make mindfulness accessible and convenient. Our goal is to help individuals integrate mindfulness into their daily lives, overcoming obstacles and promoting mental well-being.


**Aim**

We hope to provide users with a user-friendly journaling application that not only serves as a digital diary but also offers tools and resources to enhance their mental health and personal growth journey.


**User Stories**

1. As a user, I want to easily access a journaling feature, so I can document my thoughts and experiences throughout the day.
2. As a user, I want to search through my past journal entries, so I can reflect on my progress over time.
3. As a user, I want a way to track my mood throughout the day, so i can track my emotional patterns.
4. As a user, I want to add notes to my mood entries, so I can provide context for why I felt a certain way.
5. As a user, I want to set mindfulness goals, so I can stay motivated to practice regularly.
6. As a user, I want to access guided meditation sessions and the ability to choose the duration of my meditation sessions, so I can fit them into my schedule.
7. As a user, I want to customize the app’s settings to reflect my preferences for features and notifications, so the app works best for me.

**How are we different from similar platforms**

Super-simplistic UI and limited functions avoids distracting content and makes it more intuitive.

The name of our project and mobile application is MindSpace. MindSpace is an application that acts as a digital journal. It has features that not only facilitates journaling, but also promotes overall wellness by incorporating features such as mood tracking, goal setting, and reflection exercises. 

Our motivation behind the project stems from recognising the importance of mental well-being and therapeutic effects of journaling, providing users with an easy way to get into the habit of journaling and introducing them to the other aspects of practicing mindfulness, overall improving their quality of life. 

Potential users could be busy professionals that want to practice mindfulness on the go despite their busy schedules, students dealing with stress and anxiety that want a way to track their mood and identify patterns to better manage their emotions or wellness enthusiasts who want to engage in mindfulness activities to increase self-awareness and resilience.
