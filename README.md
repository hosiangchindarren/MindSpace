**Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Project Gemini

**Motivation** 

Our motivation stems from recognizing the importance of mental well-being and the therapeutic benefits of journaling. We aim to create a digital platform that not only facilitates journaling but also promotes overall wellness by incorporating features such as mood tracking, goal setting, and reflection exercises. During a Sectional Class, me and my teammate were having a discussion about mindfulness, when our groupmates dialed in on our conversation. We realised they were unaware of what the term ‘mindfulness’ meant and some had never even heard it before. After our explanation, they cited the lack of time, information and general inconvenience associated with physical writing as barriers preventing them from practicing it. Thus, the idea was born to create an app that could help use technology to streamline the process of practicing mindfulness while making it easier to make a habit out of it. 


**Aim**

We hope to provide users with a user-friendly journaling application that not only serves as a digital diary but also offers tools and resources to enhance their mental health and personal growth journey.

**How are we different from similar platforms**

Super-simplistic UI and limited functions avoids distracting content and makes it more intuitive.

The name of our project and mobile application is MindSpace. MindSpace is an application that acts as a digital journal. It has features that not only facilitates journaling, but also promotes overall wellness by incorporating features such as mood tracking, goal setting, and reflection exercises. 

Our motivation behind the project stems from recognising the importance of mental well-being and therapeutic effects of journaling, providing users with an easy way to get into the habit of journaling and introducing them to the other aspects of practicing mindfulness, overall improving their quality of life. 

Potential users could be busy professionals that want to practice mindfulness on the go despite their busy schedules, students dealing with stress and anxiety that want a way to track their mood and identify patterns to better manage their emotions or wellness enthusiasts who want to engage in mindfulness activities to increase self-awareness and resilience.
